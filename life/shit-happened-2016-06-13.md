# 13/06/2016 Shit happened.

I have been training and preparing for this competition since february. So I had almost four months to get my body in a
right condition. A few words about the event. It's called "alpine double-event" and is organized by the mountain club of
which I'm a member. The competition consists of two parts - running 20 km and climbing and if you want to climb you have
to be within the time limit. My limit was one hour and forty minutes. Not so fast for a well-prepared runner. So I consider
myself a person who would be within the required time. I ran this distance in the same contest a few years ago and my
time was ten minutes slower than the target one. But I didn't prepare for that attempt and was in incomparable shape to
the present event.

I have trained a lot, almost every day. The running distance was located in the park with the hills. So I ran a lot
amongst them. The week before the competition I tested myself and ran more than fifteen kilometers on the same route
keeping the speed as it should be in the competition. I was really fine and felt healthy and strong enough. I could run
more easily.

So everything seemed fine and went as I planned. I decided to keep training the week before the competition and also
climbed a lot. Maybe that was my main mistake - I'll talk about it a little bit later.

I asked my friend Volodya who is a good runner to run with me and help me to keep the speed during the distance. Volodya
is a great athlete so it seemed that this pace would be easy for him and he could just work out. He agreed and everything
was perfect. Even the rainy weather changed to the sunny one so the terrain in the park became dry.

The distance consisted of four 5km-laps. It's important to mention.

We started very fast. So the first lap was two minutes faster than the limit time. The second lap was slower but fast
enough. And then we almost completed the third lap. It was hot and sunny - the first real summer day this year. I was
already tired(it's funny that my heart-rate monitor broke  just before the competition) but self-confident and believed
that we could keep the pace in the last lap. I talked with my partner about it and then the shit happened.

I felt I couldn't control my legs - they started to move independently from my mind and then my body was shaking from
side to side. It was maybe two or five seconds. And then I didn't remember anything. Actually I fainted. So let's imagine
that I fell down - it's funny that I can't remember it because I don't know really how it was. People took care of me,
doing something with my body.

The next episode - I was lying in the shadow of a tree. I can't remember my thoughts in that moment - but the first
action I did was say goodbye to my breakfast. I was helpless. Every move was hard to do - so I just leaned on the tree-trunk
behind my head. My head was dizzy - thoughts were jumping and changing each other. I tried to concentrate and realize
what had happened and how long  I was unconscious. Volodya was here - he explained me what happened. There was also a
beautiful girl I didn't know - she gave me some food and was very kind.

The feelings were strong. I was scared. I mean, really scared. As if someone suddenly sank a knife in my back. And this
'someone' was an evil copy of me. Now I know that I can destroy myself with ease.

I considered myself a loser. Why did that happen to me? Am I so weak?
I supposed that the people who saw me at that moment thought the same. Of course, it wasn't true - most of them didn't
really care. Some guy(I didn't know him) talked with me. He told me about his experience - that he was in the same
situation. That was very sympathetic. And he wasn't alone.

By the way, I was so low that I couldn't be thankful. I had just to say 'thank you' and try to smile.
That's the thing I regret.

After an hour or so I was ok - looked like a zombie, I suppose, but happy as a kid.

A week has passed since that accident and something changed. It's trivial, but I believe I became stronger. Maybe not
stronger but better prepared - I know a lot more about myself.

I'm grateful about this moment to the universe. It taught me about myself a lot. How fragile could I be.
It changed my mind about my body, my health, about my behavior. I have to be more careful and protect myself.

Hints for the future me:

 - don't take it seriously
 - take a rest
 - use your heart-rate sensor - it's very important
 - wear a hat if sunny
