# 30/04/2016 Being a coal miner

I'm an alpinist and I want to explain(mostly to myself) why I do this. Why do I have this need - to reflect on it?
Because mountaineering is a very special kind of activity and it influences other parts of my life - so it's a very
important part. It's not just about fitness or being in good shape. No. It's too complex for this. Also, it is risky stuff.
I would be lying if I say that everything is under control and nothing bad could happen. It really depends.
So considering this background I'd like to write this post.

I'll try to describe what it is like to be a mountaineer. Just imagine a place full of stones and ice. There is no
life there - it's a dead place. Partial pressure is low compared to the normal levels - so it's hard to get oxygen.
The sun can burn more strongly because of a thinner atmosphere. So a mountain is not a good place to live or to hang out.
Really.

I mentioned that alpinism is potentially dangerous. People die in mountains every year. It is said that the main point
of alpinism is safety - nothing else matters except your life. And it's true. Your safety depends on many factors -
your health, your mental and physical conditions and conditions of your partners, experience and skills, organization
and many other factors. I remember the phrase of one seasoned alpinist. He said that he knew of many deaths, but only
one death was caused by an external reason - the man died struck by the lightning. I believe that if you do everything
right - you'll be ok. That's my mantra. There is something great that mountains give you. I'd like to say a few words about it.

First of all I'd like to talk about people in mountains. They are great. They behave differently - they are more kind,
friendly, and honest than in a usual environment. I don't know why but it's true. My best friend Lesha is an alpinist
too and I trust him with my life and he does too. Our trainer Alexey Viktorovich taught us so much about being strong
in the mountains. And many others. I am grateful to them. But that's not the point of a story. So let's continue.

Another thing that is great about mountains and not so obvious is that mountains give you an opportunity to become a
better person. When you are in the mountains you are under pressure and it is the best environment to keep growing and
evolving. Something about the comfort zone- you know. So in mountains you are out of this zone more than anywhere.
I have been doing mountaineering for about five years and I can say that it works.

When climbing a mountain you are in a flow. You are concentrated on your task, getting feedback very soon, doing many
simple or not so simple operations to accomplish the main goal. It's a very joyful process. Also, I remember my
feelings after a hard route - I was so calm and so happy - everything was in the right place. I felt... harmony.

Mountains are the great divider. It divides you from superficial, not important things, from time-wasting things. From
things that society imposes on you. I realize this very clearly in the mountains. It's great to clear your brain sometimes.

These reasons are very rational and self-proven and sound great and I like them. And they are good enough but I doubt
that these ones are the original ones. It looks like an explanation or justification. You know, when I started doing it
I didn't know these reasons existed. But maybe Iâ€™m wrong. Anyway.

I was very close to my grandfather and he told me a lot about his life. He was working in the mine. He was a coal miner.
And I knew a lot about this. It's a hard and dangerous job. Maybe it's the hardest one and it's thankless. Sometimes in
the mountains I felt myself like a coal miner from grandpa's tales. If he could hear it he would probably laugh at me.
And I know, it sounds weird and irrational. But I try to find the truth. Maybe that's my reason for being alpinist.
